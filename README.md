### Project Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between lifestyle and mental health. I studied factors like stress, sleep, diet, exercise and social interaction to identify key trends and promote positive habit changes using SQL Server for analysis and Excel for visualization.

### Data Cleaning
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Removing duplicates.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Verifying/Standardizing column data type.
5. Replacing inconsistent values.
6. Trimming text values to get rid of unnecessary spacing.
