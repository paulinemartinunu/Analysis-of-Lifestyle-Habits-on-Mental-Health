### Project Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between lifestyle and mental health. I studied factors like stress, sleep, diet, exercise and social interaction to identify key trends and promote positive habit changes using SQL Server for analysis and Excel for visualization.

### Data Cleaning
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Removing duplicates.
3. Handling missing values.
4. Verifying/Standardizing column data type.
5. Replacing inconsistent values.
6. Trimming text values to get rid of unnecessary spacing.

### Key Questions Explored

- How do lifestyle habits and mental health outcomes vary by country?
- How do gender differences interact with lifestyle habits and mental health?
- Which lifestyle factors show the strongest correlation with happiness levels?
- Are there identifiable clusters of people with similar lifestyle patterns?

### Key Findings
**1. Country-Specific Patterns**
- Germany: Best work-life balance, with the lowest stress levels and the fewest mental health conditions reported.
- Canada:  Highest average happiness level and lowest average work hours.
- Japan: Lowest average happiness level and highest work hours.
- USA: Highest stress levels and the highest rates of mental health conditions.

**2. Gender Differences**
- The data shows that women in India and Japan face higher stress levels and are diagnosed with mental health conditions more often than other groups.
-  Men who exercise more tend to have higher stress levels and higher chances of being diagnosed with a mental health condition.
-  Interestingly, even with long work hours, others in Japan have the lowest stress levels.

**3. Happiness-Related Lifestyle Factors**
- Longer workweeks are associated with lower happiness scores.
- Spending a lot of time on screens is linked to feeling less happy.

### Recommendations
- Build a work environment where people can thrive and feel happy.
- Promote "Active Commuting" initiatives, such as walking or cycling to work, to increase daily exercise without demanding extra time.
- Offer flexible work arrangements and childcare support to help alleviate the dual pressures often faced by working women.
- Train managers to measure output, not hours. Recognize and reward efficiency and results, not just time spent at a desk.
- Create environments where people feel safe to speak up about workload, stress, or needing help without fear of penalty.
- Equip leaders to spot signs of burnout, have supportive conversations about mental health, and model healthy boundaries.

### Final Thought
The data shows mental health is deeply connected to daily structure—how we work, rest, and connect. Effective solutions must therefore be practical, culturally aware, and integrated into the fabric of our daily lives and workplaces.

### Limitations
1. Sampling Bias: Uneven representation across countries and genders limits generalizability.
2. Self-Reported Data: Subjective measures may not reflect objective reality.
3. Cross-Sectional Design: Cannot establish causation, only correlation.
4. Cultural Differences: Happiness measures may be interpreted differently across cultures.
